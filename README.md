Google Docs Clone – Flutter Project
This project is a lightweight collaborative word document editor built using Flutter, replicating key features of Google Docs with a focus on real-time editing and collaboration.

Core Features:
Real-Time Document Collaboration: Multiple users can edit the same document simultaneously, with instant synchronization across all active sessions.

Invitation-Based Access: Users can share editable documents by sending a unique invite link, allowing others to join and collaborate on the same file.

Rich Text Editing: Supports basic text formatting like bold, italics, underline, headings, bullet points, and alignment using the flutter_quill package.

Document Creation & Editing: Users can create and manage multiple word documents from within the app interface.

Authentication: Login and registration handled securely via Firebase Authentication (Google Sign-In or Email/Password).

Tech Stack:
Frontend: Flutter (Cross-platform – Mobile & Web)

Backend: Firebase (Firestore for real-time updates, Firebase Auth for authentication)

Editor: flutter_quill for rich-text editing

Collaboration: Real-time updates implemented using Firestore streams

Note:
No cloud file storage is used — documents are managed in real-time and accessed via invite links.

Documents are stored temporarily or until deleted by the creator.
